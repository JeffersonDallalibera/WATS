# WATS Executable Environment Variable Fix

## ðŸš¨ Problem Fixed:

The executable was failing with this error:

```
ValueError: VariÃ¡veis de ambiente do banco (DB_TYPE, DB_SERVER, DB_DATABASE, DB_UID, DB_PWD) sÃ£o obrigatÃ³rias.
```

## âœ… Solution Applied:

### 1. Modified `build_executable.spec`:

- Added `.env` file to the `datas` section
- Now includes: `datas=[('assets', 'assets'), ('.env', '.')]`

### 2. Updated `run.py`:

- Added support for both script and executable modes
- Uses `sys._MEIPASS` when running as executable
- Uses `os.path.dirname(__file__)` when running as script

### 3. Rebuilt the executable:

- The `.env` file is now embedded in the executable
- Database configuration is loaded correctly
- Application starts without errors

## ðŸŽ¯ What This Means:

âœ… **The executable now works independently** - no need for external .env file
âœ… **Database credentials are embedded** - secure and portable
âœ… **Both script and executable modes work** - consistent behavior

## ðŸ”„ Future Rebuilds:

When you rebuild the executable using:

- `rebuild_exe.bat`
- Or: `C:/Users/Jefferson/Documents/wats/venv/Scripts/python.exe -m PyInstaller build_executable.spec --clean`

The .env file will automatically be included in the new executable.

## ðŸ”’ Security Note:

The .env file (including database passwords) is now embedded in the executable.
Make sure to:

- Keep the executable secure
- Don't distribute it to unauthorized users
- Consider using environment-specific .env files if needed

## âœ… Status: FIXED

Your WATS application executable now starts successfully! ðŸŽ‰
