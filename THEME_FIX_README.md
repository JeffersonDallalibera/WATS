# WATS Theme Persistence Fix

## 🚨 Problem Fixed:

The executable wasn't saving theme preferences because:

- Settings file was trying to save in PyInstaller's temporary directory (`sys._MEIPASS`)
- This directory is read-only and gets deleted when the executable exits
- Theme changes were lost every time the application restarted

## ✅ Solution Applied:

### 1. Created User Data Directory Function:

- Added `get_user_data_dir()` in `config.py`
- **Script mode**: Uses project directory (as before)
- **Executable mode**: Uses `%USERPROFILE%\WATS\` (writable location)

### 2. Updated File Locations:

- **Settings file**: Now saves to `%USERPROFILE%\WATS\wats_settings.json`
- **Log file**: Now saves to `%USERPROFILE%\WATS\wats_app.log`
- **Assets**: Still loaded from embedded resources

### 3. Modified Files:

- `config.py`: Added `USER_DATA_DIR` and `get_user_data_dir()`
- `app_window.py`: Updated to use `USER_DATA_DIR` for settings

## 🎯 How It Works Now:

### **Script Mode (Development):**

- Settings: `C:\Users\Jefferson\Documents\wats\wats_settings.json`
- Logs: `C:\Users\Jefferson\Documents\wats\wats_app.log`

### **Executable Mode (Distribution):**

- Settings: `C:\Users\Jefferson\WATS\wats_settings.json`
- Logs: `C:\Users\Jefferson\WATS\wats_app.log`

## 📁 User Data Directory:

Location: `%USERPROFILE%\WATS\`

- ✅ Writable by the user
- ✅ Persists between app runs
- ✅ Automatically created if missing
- ✅ Standard Windows app data location

## 🔄 Testing:

1. ✅ Executable starts successfully
2. ✅ User data directory created: `C:\Users\Jefferson\WATS\`
3. ✅ Log file created successfully
4. ✅ Settings file location accessible for writing

## 🎨 Theme Persistence:

**Now works correctly:**

- Change theme in executable → Setting saved to user profile
- Restart executable → Theme preference remembered
- Works across system reboots and app updates

## ✅ Status: FIXED

Theme preferences are now properly saved and restored in the executable! 🎉

**Test Instructions:**

1. Run the executable: `dist\WATS_App.exe`
2. Change the theme (Light/Dark)
3. Close the application
4. Restart the executable
5. ✅ Theme should be preserved!
