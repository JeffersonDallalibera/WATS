## 🚀 Your executable has been successfully created!

**Location:** `dist/WATS_App.exe`
**Size:** ~13.8 MB
**Type:** Standalone executable (no Python installation required)

## 📁 Files Created:

1. **`dist/WATS_App.exe`** - Your main executable
2. **`launch_wats.bat`** - Quick launch batch file
3. **`build/`** - Build artifacts (can be deleted)

## 🎯 How to Use:

### Option 1: Direct Launch

- Double-click `dist/WATS_App.exe`

### Option 2: Batch File

- Double-click `launch_wats.bat`

## 📦 Distribution:

To distribute your application:

1. Copy `WATS_App.exe` to any Windows computer
2. Include the `assets` folder if needed (though it should be embedded)
3. No Python installation required on target machines

## 🔧 Rebuild Instructions:

To rebuild the executable after code changes:

```cmd
# Activate your virtual environment
cd "C:\Users\Jefferson\Documents\wats"
venv\Scripts\activate

# Rebuild
python -m PyInstaller build_executable.spec --clean
```

## ⚙️ Advanced Build Options:

### For smaller executable (slower startup):

```cmd
python -m PyInstaller build_executable.spec --clean --upx-dir="path\to\upx"
```

### For debugging (with console window):

Edit `build_executable.spec` and change:

```python
console=True,  # Shows console for debugging
```

### For different icon:

Replace `assets/ats.ico` with your custom icon

## 🚨 Important Notes:

1. **Antivirus:** Some antivirus software may flag PyInstaller executables as false positives
2. **First Run:** The executable may take longer to start on first run
3. **Dependencies:** All Python dependencies are bundled in the executable
4. **Assets:** The `assets` folder is embedded in the executable
